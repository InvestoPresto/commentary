title: Banking Sector - Attractive valuations, short term weakness
published: true
---

Short Term Outlook
===================
The short term outlook for the banking sector remains weak due to overall macroeconomic weakness, high interest rates and falling investor confidence.

1. RBI unexpectedly kept rates constant during its last midterm policy citing high inflation among other reasons. This is a negative for rate sensitive sectors such as banking.

2. S&P and Fitch’s recent downgrades of India’s sovereign ratings followed by their downgrades of several Indian banks are negative developments for this sector. The threat of India losing its investment grade status is very real and if that happens, banking stocks among others will take a severe beating due to investors fleeing the Indian markets to safe havens like gold/US$.

3. Falling GDP growth, a very weak rupee and global economic uncertainty (mainly in Europe) are all big negatives.

Short term recommendations
===========================
The overall weakness in the markets is likely to overshadow the fundamentals in the short run. The falling rupee is not going to encourage foreign investors as their dollar returns would be adversely impacted by the exchange rate that seems to be going down the drain. Any further downgrades are going to spell short term doom for the Indian markets. All these factors having been taken into account, our short term recommendations for stocks in the banking sector are as follows:

Long Term Outlook
=====================
Barring substantial deterioration in the economic scenario, political crises or a drastic slowdown in the global economy, we feel that the long term outlook for the banking sector is promising.

We can’t say when it will happen, but policy paralysis will have to inevitably end someday. Attractive valuations will bring back investors some day; later if not sooner.  India’s seemingly lame government policies can choke investment in the short term but cannot hold it off forever. Widespread criticism from business leaders, the opposition and the common man will take effect someday if not today. No government can afford to anger its businessmen forever. Reforms will be undertaken eventually; attractive valuations will bring back investors and stock prices will eventually go up.

Over the course of the next 1-2 years, we expect the interest rates to come down substantially. In fact, we are most likely done with the worst part of the interest rate cycle. A falling rupee will help exporters

Fundamentals
================
Asset Quality
--------------

Asset quality at most banks barring ICICI and SBI is under control as can be seen by the Gross NPAs to advances ratios. ICICI being a very aggressive bank has the highest Gross NPA to advances ratio. However, it is very well capitalized and can absorb some of the resulting losses without much trouble.

The large banks also seem well capitalized barring SBI. Notice overall Capital adequacy ratios are well above the RBI mandated minimum in all cases. The provisioning coverage ratios are especially good at the private banks. A further deterioration in the economy will hurt banks with higher NPAs. We feel that existing NPA levels are fairly good indicators of things to come.

 On this front, Axis Bank and Yes Bank score very well, with the lowest Gross NPA/Advances ratios. However, we feel that SBI and Axis Bank need to improve their CARs to give more confidence to investors. But that being said, Axis Bank has very low NPAs and that, to some extent, can justify their CAR of 13.66%.

Growth
-----------

Yes Bank, being a small bank has shown fantastic growth over the last few years. It remains our top pick mainly for this reason. All major banks have shown good growth in top line as well as bottom line numbers. SBI has disappointed in terms of 4 year growth in EPS though it is not entirely fair to compare private banks with PSU banks. Axis Bank has impressed with an extraordinary 36.85% EPS growth p.a. over the last 4 years.  ICICI Bank has grown fairly well.

SBI has an excellent branch network with over 14,000 branches. We feel that Axis Bank has potential to grow substantially over the next few years as it is small and has been targeting retail clients. Axis Bank’s branch network is not as well developed as ICICI Bank’s or HDFC Bank’s. However, it has been growing fairly well over the last 1 year. HDFC Bank has been growing its branch network at a strong 28% p.a.

Profitability
-------------

The top private banks seem to be fairly profitable with HDFC Bank ruling the roost on this front. Driven by the highest net interest margin and CASA ratio, HDFC Bank is the best among the lot when it comes to profitability. All the major banks being considered here have healthy CASA ratios and NIMs. Yes Bank has a very low CASA ratio and a corresponding NIM. However, we feel that NIMs will improve as Yes Bank grows its CASA ratio and gains access to cheap funds via this channel. Savings rate deregulation will help it substantially as it now offers 6% interest on savings accounts.

Valuations
-------------
All banks seem to be trading at attractive valuations when measured by their trailing P/E ratios. In fact, all banks other than HDFC Bank and SBI are trading at deep discounts to their average historic P/E ratios (since Jan ’09). HDFC Bank, being a conservative bank seems to be the darling of investors. Its P/E ratio has not been as volatile as some of the others. However, we are not very comfortable with HDFC Bank getting such a high premium (P/E) over ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. This is the only reason for not placing a “Buy” recommendation on HDFC Bank.

Axis Bank has taken a beating and is trading at about 12 times trailing earnings, a far cry from the 30+ multiples it commanded towards the end of 2010. This deflation in P/E does not seem to be accompanied by any fundamental weaknesses specific to the bank but seems to be a result of the overall weakness in the economy. ICICI and Yes Bank look attractive on the valuation front, trading at 15 times and 12 times trailing earnings. SBI is trading at about 12 times trailing earnings, slightly higher than its historic average earnings multiple of about 11.

Long term recommendations
=========================
Buy recommendations for Axis Bank and Yes Bank.
-----------------------------------------------
Overall, we feel that Axis Bank and Yes Bank are the most attractive among the well-known banks. Yes Bank probably has the best potential for growth and is fairly valued. Axis Bank is attractively valued at a 36.89% discount to its average P/E(trailing 12 months) over the last three and a half years. It has the potential to catch up with ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank in terms of size, in the long term. Both banks (Yes Bank and Axis Bank) seem to have excellent asset quality (0.22% and 1.06% gross NPA/advances) and growth history (36.85% and 57.9% 4 year CAGR in EPS). It is for these reasons that we are bullish on these 2 banks and rate them as “Buy”s. The only concerns for these banks are capitalization (for Axis Bank) and low CASA ratio (for Yes Bank). However, we think that these problems will be addressed in the long run.

 We also set minimum target prices of about Rs 1578 and Rs 447 on Axis Bank and Yes Bank respectively based on reversion to the average historic P/E as well as a premium for growth potential.

Hold recommendations for ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank
--------------------------------------------------
We feel that ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank are attractively priced going by their current earnings multiples relative to their historic multiples. However, we are not fully comfortable with the asset quality of ICICI Bank despite its good capitalization and healthy provisioning. Therefore, we place a “Hold” on it. HDFC is profitable, has impeccable asset quality and a history of being conservative. It is probably the best private bank to deposit your money. However, we feel that it is expensive at the current levels (24.69 times trailing earnings) compared to its peers. Therefore, we place a “Hold” on it. Based on reversion to historic average P/Es, we set a minimum long term target price of Rs 1,211 on ICICI Bank. Using the same logic and factoring in a premium for excellent profitability, asset quality and a conservative approach to banking, we set a minimum long term target price of Rs 651 for HDFC Bank.

Sell recommendation on SBI
---------------------------
We are not bullish on SBI due to its low asset quality, low profit growth over the last few years and its current valuation (12.48 times trailing earnings).
