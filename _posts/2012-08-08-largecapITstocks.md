Short Term Outlook
--------------------
The short term outlook for the IT industry seems shaky mainly due to the prevailing global economic uncertainty. USA and Europe are the main markets for India’s IT companies and a further slowdown in these economies are likely to lead to cuts in the IT budgets of companies, thereby affecting revenues of IT companies in India. Apart from lower revenues, margins too may be affected by a further slowdown in the global economy leading to lower earnings.

<!---abstract-->

We believe that banking and IT are the best sectors to be in at the moment, given the strong fundamentals of the sectors. However from an absolute return perspective, this may not be the best time to enter the market due to the overall weak market sentiment exacerbated by uncertainties in government policy and taxation. Therefore, unless there is a broad based market rally on improved market sentiment, there is no reason to believe that this sector is going to give investors positive returns in the short term.

Short Term Recommendations
----------------------------

Apart from a weak rupee which is a strong positive for exporters like IT companies, there is nothing to cheer about on the fundamental front. Therefore, we advise caution while investing in this sector.  TCS has shown exceptional resilience in an extremely tough business environment and beat analyst expectations on the earnings front last quarter. 

The same cannot be said about Infosys or Wipro. Infosys has taken quite a beating over the last one month, losing over 11% in market capitalization due to poor earnings and disappointing earnings guidance. There may be some upside on bargain hunting in this stock despite the weak sentiment. 

Wipro’s most recent results met analyst expectations but poor earnings growth and low profitability are the reasons we don’t like this stock. The stock lost over 14% this month. There may be some room for a small upside driven by bargain hunters despite the poor fundamentals. However, we feel that any deterioration in the global economic scenario or a further weakening in market sentiment is likely to hit the stock hard.
