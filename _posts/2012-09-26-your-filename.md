It is to be noted that on the 14th of this month, the Union Government allowed FDI up to 49% in Aviation, 74% in Television Broadcasting and 51% in Multi-Brand Retailing. However, it remains to be seen if the announcement will arrest the concerns pointed out by the Chief Economic Advisor.

Dr Rajan’s comments come in wake of a series of downgrades by international rating agencies and global investment banks of the economy’s growth outlook. On Monday, S&P cut its growth forecast of India for the current financial year to 5.5% from 6.5%.
