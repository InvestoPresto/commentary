Vijay Mallya, the Chairman of the debt ridden Kingfisher Airlines, today confirmed that his airline is in talks with foreign airlines (names undisclosed) to sell a stake to them. The move follows the central government’s decision to allow FDI in aviation, announced on September 14th, 2012.

Post the announcement, the share price of Kingfisher Airlines soared to Rs 15.70 up 9.03% from yesterday’s close.

Off late, Kingfisher Airlines has been facing turbulent times. The company has been finding it difficult to service its debt which amounts to Rs 7,500 crores. In June, its lessors had withdrawn as many as 34 aircrafts due to non-payment of lease rentals, which added to around Rs 1000 crores. The airline incurred losses of Rs 2,328.01 crores in the financial year ending March 2012. Further, its losses for the quarter ending June 2012 were Rs 650.79 crores.

Once counted among the top three airlines in the country with its market share in double digits, Kingfisher Airlines’ market share today stands at a meagre 3.2% (as per DGCA’s latest report).
