April 2012 Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and May 2012 inflation data (expected to be out tomorrow) may influence RBI’s policy change in their mid-quarter monetary policy review on June 18. IIP is expected to raise by 1.4 % and the inflation rate is expected to be around 7.4%. The first round of advance tax payments due on 15 June will provide pointers to Q1 corporate earnings

The Finance Minister Mr. Pranab Mukherjee said that the government plans to introduce Direct Tax Code in the parliament’s monsoon session. The Parliament Standing Committee is expected to submit their report on Goods and Services tax soon. The GST will reform India’s indirect tax structure which comprises central excise duty, service tax, state tax, etc. The GST, which was supposed to be rolled out in April 2010, did not receive support from many states.

Under GST, the taxation burden will be divided equitably between manufacturing and services, through a lower tax rate by increasing the tax base and minimizing exemptions. It is expected to help build a transparent and corruption-free tax administration. GST will be is levied only at the destination point, and not at various points (from manufacturing to retail outlets). Currently, a manufacturer needs to pay tax when a finished product moves out from a factory, and it is again taxed at the retail outlet when sold.

It is estimated that India will gain $15 billion a year by implementing GST as it would promote exports, raise employment and boost growth. It will divide the tax burden equitably between manufacturing and services.

In the GST system, both Central and State taxes will be collected at the point of sale. Both components (the Central and State GST) will be charged on the manufacturing cost. This will benefit individuals as prices are likely to come down. Lower prices will lead to more consumption, thereby helping companies.

The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu say that the information technology systems and the administrative infrastructure are not ready to implement GST. States have sought assurances that their existing revenues will be protected. The central government has offered to compensate States in case of a loss in revenues. Some States fear that if the uniform tax rate is lower than their existing rates, it will hit their tax kitty. The government believes that dual GST will lead to better revenue collection for States. However, backward and less-developed States could see a fall in tax collections. GST could see better revenue collection for some States as the consumption of goods and services will rise.

In an effort to boost the slowing economy, last week, Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh announced a big push for the infrastructure sector. Some key highlights of the announcement were as following:

• **Roadways**: The government plans to award 9,500 kilometres of roads for construction this year and over 4,000 kms for maintenance under the new system.

• **Railways**: The government plans to award work on the Elevated Rail Corridor in Mumbai, two new Loco manufacturing units and the public private partnership (PPP) stretch of the Dedicated Freight Corridor. It also plans to redevelop 4 or 5 stations through PPP mode in the current year.

• **Shipping**: The government has set the challenging task of awarding work for two new major PPP Ports, the first in decade. It has also set aspiration for capacity addition with targets which are three times that for the last year.

• **Civil Aviation**: The government plans to award three new Greenfield airports in Navi Mumbai, Goa and Kannur and new international airports at Lucknow, Varanasi, Coimbatore, Trichy and Gaya in the current year. They also intend on developing two new hubs with the aim of making India a transit point.

• **Power**: The government plans to add a record 18,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity this year.
